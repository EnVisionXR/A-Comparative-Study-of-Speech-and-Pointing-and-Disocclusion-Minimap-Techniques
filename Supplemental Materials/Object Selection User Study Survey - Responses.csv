sometimes the minimap still put many objects close to each other, making it hard to see or tell, and sometimes I double selected two objects at once because they are basically overlaying on top of each other.

This helps make the search must easier and faster.","Sometimes in areas with not a lot of shapes, visually finding the shape is much quicker than using the minimap search feature. In other words, the benefits this feature brings is rather situational and may slow the search down in certain conditions (when an area doesn't have a lot of shapes).","","4","1","5","1","5","1","4","2","5","1","7","2","3","2","6","1","5","7","5","7","7","7","7","7","Speech recognition is very useful when there is a large quantity of shapes to select, or when there's difficulty in finding a shape, or when there's trouble selecting a shape (e.g. stacked on each other or behind another shape), or simply from fatigue after manually selecting shapes.","The slight delay in starting up the system (and the time it takes to speak) may mean that it is sometimes faster to manually select shapes. This applies in cases when I only have to select 1-2 shapes, and that they are easily spottable, not stacked on or behind other shapes.","Once again I believe the benefits of the speech recognition system is situational, although it is much more useful than the previous minimap feature and can be used in a lot more situations (in fact, speech recognition can benefit cases under most conditions). Also, I occasionally would forget the name of the shape, and would have to select a shape to remember what it's called before using speech recognition and this creates further delays. As such, I believe it would be more beneficial if there's another screen that can be placed in the space around me (like the selection screen) that shows a list of the shapes and their names for quick reference.","4","2","4","1","5","1","5","2","4","2","5","4","1","1","3","1","6","6","6","1","2","2","2","2","Technique 2","Although technique 1 was more interesting and fun overall, technique 2 completes the task faster in a more efficient way. Both techniques makes selecting shapes (including those stacked or behind other shapes) much easier.","Speech recognition requires that you remember the name of the shape specifically, although this could easily be resolved with a list of shape and name references by the side. Point and click could cause fatigue after some time and would have difficulty selecting shapes stacked or behind one another. There is not much to dislike in the minimap feature as it is a fun and innovative method to find shapes. It also serves it's intended purpose well. However, it is not as efficient as the speech recognition method.","A combination of all 3 methods (minimap, point and click, speech recognition) would be the best as they all perform better under different conditions. This would give the user a more versatile range of tools to work with to help them accomplish the task faster. I believe all the features are needed to allow the user to adapt to the situation and select the right tools to complete the shape selection task in the shortest amount of time.","Very interesting and fun experiment!"

I also liked the mini map itself since it allowed for the search area to be zoomed in on which made it easier to find shapes far away","I think that having to region to mini map before selected a shape could take longer in some cases where the hape is already seen by itself and could be selected without the mini map","","4","3","3","2","4","2","3","4","4","4","6","3","5","7","6","2","6","3","3","5","5","6","5","4","This speech technique was very efficient and took a lot less time since I didnt have to select each target by hand. Quite responsive results eventhough it was relying on servers for voice processing.","There were some errors relating to shape names such as pyramid cuboids and it heard keyboard instead of cuboid.

","the speech system combined with the first technique would be best because it allows the easy objects to be selected straight away but more difficult to fine or higher quantity objects can also be solved as quickly as possible with the speech feature",""

Especially useful when I was unable to see objects in dense regions. I also like how the minimap freezes when I let go of the left trigger as it means I do not have to hold the laser still. The list of objects showing up on the right of the minimap was very nice as I could see all the objects in overlapped areas, and again I liked how the list of objects would freeze as soon as i let go of the right trigger. ","the size of the minimap was not in fixed place, as i had to make sure my right hand was always holding the controller up whilst I was still searching for the objects, which became tiring after some time. Also, the grab button was only working at a specific distance from the object, which makes sense but after practicing a few times I thought I knew how far I would have to be for it to register a grab, but sometimes I would have to click 4 times in order for it to work. I would have liked it even more if there was an option for us to rotate the whole space so that we can view it from a different angle, i.e., if we wanted to view the cluster of objects from the side rather than from the front (still being the same distance away).","","4","1","5","1","4","2","3","1","5","4","8","8","9","10","8","2","7","3","6","7","5","6","5","5","the fact that I can tell the system what object to select ","how inaccurate the speak recognition is.
